What is the differWhat is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge and a rebase both handle changes made to a repository. The large difference is the way each handles the history of the repository. 
A merge will preserve the history of the the reposity in whole, while a rebase will edit parts of the history (specifically the base commit) in favor of a more linear history.
What is a remote repository?
A remote reposity is a repo usually shared between a group that allows for everyone to make local changes on their own machine
and then merge with the remote repository for everyone in the group to access and integrate their own changes into. This is primarily helpful when 
different people are working on different features of a project and need to ensure they both integrate into the application without cause issues with
the other integration.
