What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge and a rebase both handle changes made to a repository. The large difference is the way each handles the history of the repository. 
A merge will preserve the history of the the reposity in whole, while a rebase will edit parts of the history (specifically the base commit) in favor of a more linear history.
